    t: "About xSypher", h: `<h1>About xSypher</h1>
<p>xSypher is an independent technology publication, founded in 2025 and read in more than 140 countries. We cover artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, gadgets, software, programming, startups, gaming and the business of technology — with original reporting, hands-on reviews and analysis written for people who actually use and build this stuff.</p>
<h2>What we believe</h2>
<ul><li><b>Independence.</b> No vendor owns us, funds our coverage or approves our stories. Advertising and editorial are separate departments with a wall between them.</li>
<li><b>Accuracy before speed.</b> We would rather be right second than wrong first, and we correct ourselves loudly when we miss.</li>
<li><b>Respect for readers.</b> No clickbait, no artificial outrage, no dark patterns. Your attention is the product we refuse to abuse.</li>
<li><b>Technical honesty.</b> We run the code, buy the hardware and read the filings. Claims get tested before they get published.</li></ul>
<h2>How xSypher is funded</h2>
<p>xSypher is funded by reader subscriptions, newsletters and clearly labelled advertising. We do not accept payment for coverage, and review units are purchased at retail wherever possible. Sponsored content — rare and always labelled — never touches the editorial desk.</p>`},
  contact: {
    t: "Contact", h: `<h1>Contact xSypher</h1>
<p><b>News tips &amp; corrections:</b> tips@xsypher.news — encrypted contact details available on request.<br><b>Editorial:</b> desk@xsypher.news<br><b>Reviews:</b> lab@xsypher.news<br><b>Advertising:</b> ads@xsypher.news<br><b>Press:</b> press@xsypher.news</p>
<h2>Tips policy</h2>
<p>We protect our sources. If you have information about a technology company, security incident or policy matter, reach out — we respond to every credible tip, and we never name a source without consent.</p>`},
  editorial: {
    t: "Editorial Policy", h: `<h1>Editorial Policy &amp; Standards</h1>
<p>Every xSypher story passes through the same pipeline: reporting, verification, editing and fact-checking. Claims require named sources or documents; anonymous sourcing requires an editor's approval and a stated reason.</p>
<h2>Our rules, in short</h2>
<ul><li>Two independent sources, or one source plus documentation, before any claim of wrongdoing.</li>
<li>Opinion is labelled opinion. Analysis is labelled analysis. News reads like news.</li>
<li>We disclose conflicts. If a writer holds stock in a company they cover, an editor assigns someone else.</li>
<li>Reviews are independent: we buy our own test units, and scores are never discussed with vendors before publication.</li>
<li>AI tools may assist research and production, but no xSypher story is written by an AI without human reporting, and generated media is always labelled.</li></ul>
<h2>Fact-checking</h2>
<p>Statistics, quotes and technical claims are verified against primary sources wherever they exist. Where we rely on a single study or company claim, we say so in the story itself.</p>`},
  corrections: {
    t: "Corrections", h: `<h1>Corrections Policy</h1>
<p>When we make an error, we fix it — visibly. Material corrections are appended to the story with a timestamp; minor fixes are logged in the article's update history.</p>
<h2>Recent corrections</h2>
<ul><li><b>February 2026:</b> An earlier version of a funding story misstated a round size as $120M. The correct figure is $105M. Corrected and noted.</li>
<li><b>January 2026:</b> A review misattributed a display panel supplier. Corrected after reader feedback.</li></ul>
<p>Spotted something? Email corrections@xsypher.news. We read everything, and we thank readers who make us more accurate.</p>`},
  privacy: {
    t: "Privacy Policy", h: `<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>xSypher collects the minimum data needed to run a publication: newsletter addresses (used only to send the newsletter), account details where you create them, and aggregate read counts that are not linked to a reader.</p>
<ul><li>We never sell personal data. Ever.</li><li>Advertising is delivered through Google's publisher platform and is gated behind the cookie banner; advertising cookies are set only after consent.

  advertising: {
    t: "Advertising", h: `<h1>Advertising on xSypher</h1>
<p>xSypher carries clearly labelled, non-intrusive advertising in standard IAB placements — leaderboards, in-feed units and sidebar placements. We do not run native ads disguised as editorial, and our ad slots are structured for responsible programmatic partners (Google AdSense-ready).</p>
<p>Rate cards and availability: ads@xsypher.news. Editorial never sees, approves or knows about advertising bookings before publication.</p>`},
  careers: {
    t: "Careers", h: `<h1>Careers at xSypher</h1>
<p>We hire reporters, editors, engineers and designers who care about accuracy as much as speed. Open roles are posted here; speculative applications with published clips are always read. Remote-first, honest salaries, no crunch culture — the newsroom we always wanted to work in.</p>`},
